# 🎓 University Management Backend (MERN)

This project is the **backend foundation** for a role-based University Management System.  
It focuses on **real-world enterprise practices** like authentication, authorization, clean structure, and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- 🛡️ Secure login system (JWT + Role-based access)  
- 👨‍🎓 Multiple roles: Student, Faculty, Admin  
- 🗂️ Scalable MongoDB models  
- ⚡ Middleware-based route protection  
- 🧠 Centralized error handling & validation  

---

## ✨ Current Features (Updated)
- **Role-Based Registration** → Users (Student / Faculty / Admin) auto-assigned via email format  
- **Secure Login** → JWT in httpOnly cookies, bcrypt-hashed passwords  
- **Auto Student Enrollment** → Students auto-enrolled in relevant semester & courses  
- **Faculty-Course Linkage** → Faculty can access only their assigned courses  
- **Admin Control** → Full user management (add/delete/update)  
- **Clean MVC Architecture** → Controllers, models, and reusable helpers  
- **Centralized Error Handling** → Consistent and validated API responses

## 📌 Planned Features
This is just the beginning 🚀. Over time, the backend will include:
- 📚 Course management (create/update/manage)
- 📝 Student profiles with grades & enrollment
- 📊 Admin dashboard APIs
- 🔔 Notifications system
- 📈 Analytics & reports

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose)  
- **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt  
- **Middleware:** Custom RBAC protection  
- **Testing:** Postman  

---

## 🎯 Why this Project?
Demonstrates **enterprise-level backend skills**:
- Secure authentication & RBAC from scratch  
- Modular code architecture  
- Scalable and production-ready setup  

---

## 🌟 Future Vision
This project is designed to evolve into a **complete University Management System** with both **MERN** and **Java (Spring Boot)** backend implementations — showing flexibility across tech stacks and real-world scalability.
