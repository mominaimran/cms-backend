# 🎓 University Management Backend (MERN)

This project is the **backend foundation** for a role-based University Management System.  
It is being built with a focus on **real-world enterprise practices** like authentication, authorization, clean code structure, and scalable architecture.  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- 🛡️ **Authentication & Authorization** → Secure login system with JWT + Role-based access control  
- 👨‍🎓 **User Roles** → Students, Faculty, and Admins with different permissions  
- 🗂️ **Scalable Models** → Flexible MongoDB schema design to support future features  
- ⚡ **Middleware-driven** → Protect routes and authorize users efficiently  
- 🛠️ **Error Handling & Validation** → Consistent API responses with centralized error handling  

---

## ✨ Current Features
- Admin can **register new users** (Student / Faculty / Admin)  
- Students & Faculty can **login** using their university emails  
- Admin can **delete users** securely  
- Passwords are **hashed with bcrypt**  
- JWT stored in **httpOnly cookies** for secure session handling  

---

## 📌 Planned Features
This is just the beginning 🚀. Over time, this backend will expand to include:
- 📚 **Course Management** → Faculty can create, update, and manage courses  
- 📝 **Student Profiles** → Students can view their details, enrollments, and grades  
- 📊 **Admin Dashboard APIs** → Admin can manage faculty, students, and system stats  
- 🔔 **Notifications System** → Real-time updates for students/faculty  
- 📈 **Analytics & Reports** → Generate useful insights for university management  

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose  
- **Authentication:** JWT + bcrypt  
- **Middleware:** Custom role-based route protection  
- **Testing:** Postman  

---

## 📌 API Endpoints (Current Phase)
- **POST** `/api/auth/register` → Register new user *(Admin only)*  
- **POST** `/api/auth/login` → Login (Student/Faculty/Admin)  
- **POST** `/api/auth/logout` → Logout (all roles)  
- **DELETE** `/api/users/:id` → Delete a user *(Admin only)*  

---

## 🎯 Why this Project?
This project demonstrates **enterprise-level backend development skills**:
- Building secure authentication from scratch  
- Designing **role-based access control (RBAC)**  
- Writing **clean, modular code** with controllers, routes, middleware, and models  
- Following best practices in **scalability and maintainability**  

---

💡 *The goal is to gradually evolve this into a **full University Management System backend** while keeping the architecture production-ready and recruiter-friendly.*
